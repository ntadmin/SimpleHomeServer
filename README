SimpleHomeServer

A collection of files I use to run some core home netwrok stuff on an old PC

Packages you will need (perhaps not exclusive)
----------------------------------------------
apt-get install apache2 php7.1 bind9

Files to install
----------------
Duplicate the files provided but think about ownership etc:
 - Things in bin directories should be root owned
 - Thinks in www directory should be owned by the apache user
