SimpleHomeServer

A collection of files I use to run some core home netwrok stuff on an old PC.

I want the router provided by my ISP to only do the things it has to. Everything
I can remove (DNS, DHCP, adblocking ...) I am aiming to put on this machine.

This assumes that you have set the PC up as working linux (ubuntu in my case)
server and that it has been given a fixed IP on a local network. It provides
some code and sample config files for running DNS (with adblocking) and DHCP.
Adapt to suit.

You will need to have installed all thje relevant packages, including apache2
and php7.1

Running make in the files directory will splatter all the files into their
places. Check the files out before you do this! They will need to be edited
to meet your configuration, not least thye gateway IP which is almost definitely
wrong for you!
